<p>hillhacks is entirely volunteer-run and participatory. Everyone who attends helps out on-site with daily tasks like cleaning and communications. Offer your get-it-done attitude, bright ideas, and clever hands. </p>

<p>If you would like to help before or after the event, anything from accounting to organising, we welcome your participation. </p>

<p>The best way to get started is to join the hillhacks mailing list and discover what needs to be done now.</p>

<p>We also welcome donors and sponsors to provide materials and to lower costs for our participants. Please see our Partners page in the wiki for more details </p>
