                     <p>Over the years, some questions come up again and again.  Here they are, with
answers.  Of course, if you don't see your question asked and answered, ask on
the mailing list.</p>

<p><b><em>Should I bring...</em></b></p>
<p><b>...my projects and tools?</b><br>
Oh yes, you should!  Bring your whole project group and take a code retreat or
whatever needs to be done &mdash; and get fruitful exchanges with the other
participants.  Please let us know what things you want to bring, so that we can
arrange appropriate space for you.</p>

<p><b>...my camping gear?</b><br>
Yes, please!  Bring your tents, mattresses, sleeping bags, pillows, blankets.
We have some to share, but never enough.
</p>

<p><b>...my trekking gear?</b><br>
Yes, please!  Bring your shoes, backpacks, bottles, and all that stuff, and go
for as many treks and walks you can!
<!-- XXX: (click on this link to get more info on walks&treks)-->
</p>

<p><b>...my family?</b><br>
You are welcome to bring your husband, kids, wife, parents, cousins, friends.
Please let us know the details in advance, so we can help to find appropriate
accommodation for you.  There are plenty of things to do for all ages and
interests.
</p>

<p><b>...a spontaneous session?</b><br>
Yes.  The unconference is all about spontaneous sessions.  During the main
conference days, priority is given to curated sessions, but you may be able to
schedule yourself into unused spaces.
</p>

*********
<p><b>When can I come?</b><br>
The unconference, school programme and set-up for the main conference all begin
on 15<sup>th</sup> May 2017.  We have the venue until 31<sup>st</sup> May 2017.
If you would like to come earlier or stay later, you should make your own
arrangements.  Contact the <a
  href="https://lists.hillhacks.in/mailman/listinfo/hillhackers">mailing
list</a> for pointers.
</p>

<p><b>When is the main conference?</b><br>
18-21 May 2017.
</p>

<p><b>How do I get there?</b><br>
<!-- XXX We need a travel page! -->
See the Travel page for details.
</p>

<p><b>How cold will it be up there?</b><br>
In general it will be around 25°C during the day and around 15°C at night.  Note
that we are around 2000 metres above mean sea level, temperatures often fall
below 10°C. On the other hand they have been known to rise above to 30°C too.
Weather varies, but it isn't monsoon season, so it (probably) won't rain too
much.</p> 

<p><b>What about lodging and food?</b><br>
See the Venue page for details <!-- XXX: we need a venue page -->
</p>

<p><b>I am concerned that I am too young / too old / an introvert / a
  single female / a single male / a robot / something totally
  different.</b><br>
Read our note on providing a safe and friendly place for everyone.  In previous
years, we had all age groups around, and nearly 50% of our core team are female!
<!-- XXX: really? -->  As we are surrounded by the mountains, you will always
find enough space for yourself if needed.  You have found us, that means you are
in the right place, please feel welcome!
</p>

<p><b>My family is concerned that this will be way too dangerous!</b><br>
Please have a look at the blog posts from participants from previous hillhacks
editions, and maybe show them the report or project description.  If they are
primarily concerned about the travel, shout out on the <a
  href="https://lists.hillhacks.in/mailman/listinfo/hillhackers">mailing
list</a>.  There is a good chance that others will be travelling the same route
around the same time you intend to travel.
