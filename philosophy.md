hillhacks is passionate about making, sharing, learning, and the broad concepts
of open source. Freedom, security, and environmentalism are also key to
hillhackers. All of our ideas have conjoined into something exceptionally
creative.

We are just a bunch of people that got connected by crazy and various
circumstances, in a spontaneous and still very dynamic way. Many hillhackers
change direction in life thanks to interactions during hillhacks - starting
school, quitting jobs, moving house, launching projects.

hillhacks is inclusive. Being Excellent to Each Other is a core component of
hillhacks. Everyone is welcome, regardless of economic background, race,
religion, caste, nationality, political view, gender, and age.

The Four Pillars of hillhacks

* Education: teaching expands horizons of students and the general public.
* Exchange: sharing expert-to-expert broadens our connections and ideas
* Making: gaining independence and freedom on so many levels
* Caring: shaping and developing our world, society, ethics and politics
