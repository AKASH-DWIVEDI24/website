  title: Hackable Fashion - The roots of the Sari
  abstract: "<p>The Sari, at its basic, is an unstitched fabric that can be draped into any garment of choice using just knots and pleats. It can become a pair of pants like the dancers of Odisha or a pair of shorts like the Goan fisherwomen. Or one could take inspiration from the farmlands of West Bengal and wear the Sari as a short gown or one could imitate the agricultural women of Andhra Pradesh who wear their Sari as functional, aesthetic dresses. Rta Kapur Chishti, a renowned Sari historian and a textile scholar, has documented a 108 ways to wear a Sari in her book “Saris of India” that was put together after a decade of travelling across thirteen states in India.</p>

<p>Apart from women, men in the Indian sub-continent have also been wearing the unstitched since centuries. Dhotis have been ubiquitous all through hot and humid India. In this one hour seminar, we will delve into the gender-neutral and gender-fluid Sari as a garment of choice for men, womxn and people.</p>

<p>The audience will learn how to harness the fluidity of the Sari to express themselves and their individuality. I will be taking inspiration from the ancient wisdom of our ancestors to imagine the Sari in a contemporary context. Together, we will hack the Sari to extend its capabilities beyond the popular NiVi and Gujarati drapes to realize the power and energy of the Sari.</p>

<p>The intense and interactive session will also include conversations on colonization, fluid gender, minimalism and sustainability whose narratives are intrinsically interwoven with the Sari. The seminar will be followed by draping a few members from the audience.</p>

<p>Intended audience: Art, science, history, fashion, handloom researchers and enthusiasts, intersectional feminists, and gender activists, fashion nerds.</p>"

  title: Information Architecture for Everyone
  abstract: "This talk makes an attempt to broadly answer the question “What is Information Architecture?” through examples from various spheres of life. It further outlines the foundational ways of organising information and includes a participatory activity to understand the practice of IA. I have previously presented this talk at World IA Day, and I plan to refine it further. Slides from the previous talk can be viewed here."

  title: Unfolding Origami
  abstract: "The practice of folding paper and cloth into abstract shapes and designs has existed for many centuries in Europe and Asia. However, in the 1960's this practice acquired a new language. First came the system of encoding a form in a crease pattern- a set of lines drawn on a square to represent the folds required to make a form. Following this came a system of communicating folding sequences using arrows and symbols which led to a further expansion of this language. The result of this was an explosion of new origami designs and ideas. In this sessions I will talk about a brief history of origami and how learning its language unlocked my interest in it. I will demo all the basic folds and bases used in origami and also discuss the preliminary concepts involved in designing your own origami. This session is intended for beginners."

  title: Markov Chain Models for NLP
  abstract: "<p>Markov Chains Models are the foundation of many Natural Language Processing algorithms. They ask 'given the previous X number of items in a sequence, what is likely to come next?' You can see Markov Models in action by playing with the word-suggestions when you're typing on your phone.</p>

  <ul>The workshop will cover:

      <li>The basics: what is a markov model, and how do they work? We'll do a short exercise diagramming out a model on paper, and calculating the probabilities.</li>

      <li>Some variants: Hidden-state Markov Models (HMM's), interpolated markov models, sequence generation, and Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC)</li>

      <li>Some MCM applications for NLP and bioinformatics: like voice recognition, sentence parsing, fuzzy-matching, language detection, forensic stylometry, gene-finding, and protein structure analysis</li>

      <li>If time permits, maybe the Virterbi algorithm for finding highest-probability paths through a markov model</li></ul>"

  title: Beyond Little Green Locks
  abstract: "<p>There is a general consensus to trust a web page when there is a little green lock present in the browser when we visit the page, There is a significant population still believes that this represents a shopping bag and hence a secure portal to do financial transactions.</p>

<p>Lets talk about how this lock works under the hood and mainly what it does and doesn't guarantee. The talk is moderately technical due to the nature of the problem, but we will cover the basics so its open to everyone interested in web security and privacy.</p>"
