  title: Hackable Fashion - The roots of the Sari
  abstract: "<p>The Sari, at its basic, is an unstitched fabric that can be draped into any garment of choice using just knots and pleats. It can become a pair of pants like the dancers of Odisha or a pair of shorts like the Goan fisherwomen. Or one could take inspiration from the farmlands of West Bengal and wear the Sari as a short gown or one could imitate the agricultural women of Andhra Pradesh who wear their Sari as functional, aesthetic dresses. Rta Kapur Chishti, a renowned Sari historian and a textile scholar, has documented a 108 ways to wear a Sari in her book “Saris of India” that was put together after a decade of travelling across thirteen states in India.</p>

<p>Apart from women, men in the Indian sub-continent have also been wearing the unstitched since centuries. Dhotis have been ubiquitous all through hot and humid India. In this one hour seminar, we will delve into the gender-neutral and gender-fluid Sari as a garment of choice for men, womxn and people.</p>

<p>The audience will learn how to harness the fluidity of the Sari to express themselves and their individuality. I will be taking inspiration from the ancient wisdom of our ancestors to imagine the Sari in a contemporary context. Together, we will hack the Sari to extend its capabilities beyond the popular NiVi and Gujarati drapes to realize the power and energy of the Sari.</p>

<p>The intense and interactive session will also include conversations on colonization, fluid gender, minimalism and sustainability whose narratives are intrinsically interwoven with the Sari. The seminar will be followed by draping a few members from the audience.</p>

<p>Intended audience: Art, science, history, fashion, handloom researchers and enthusiasts, intersectional feminists, and gender activists, fashion nerds.</p>"

  title: Sound and Structure 
  abstract: "<p>Hi, I am a Digital Artist and would like to present to the audience of Hillhacks one of our tools called as Sound and Structure. Its an interactive web tool where anyone can make music by drawing simple to complex shapes. The Generative music that you'll hear will be a result of some simple rules to map parameters of the shapes (like angle, x axis or y axis) to the parameters of music (like note, note duration, velocity). Sound and Structure has an element of surprise, and unexpectedness as a small change in the shape generates a new astounding sound. With these simple rules and edits to the shape, we can generate a lot of interesting soundscapes and we will explore more of that in the one hour workshop with you all.</p><p>Anybody who is interested in Generative sound, Web applications, Interactive tools, Data Sonification, Future of Sound and Performance, Music Experiments, Pure data, Live performance, Computation art, Creative coding, Digital music, Sound Design, Algorithmic Music can join us in this workshop.</p><p>Please carry your laptop or tablet to make your own generative art using our tool on your web browser</p><p>Some interesting links on Generative Music for you</p><ul><li>Brian Eno on Generative Music https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UqzVSvqXJYg</li><li>John Horton Conway on Generative Music and Cellular Automation https://vimeo.com/127413459</li><li>Gustavo Diaz Jerez- http://www.gustavodiazjerez.com/?cat=14</li></ul><p>If you like to learn more on Sound and Structure, you can click on this link below</p><p>http://timeblur.io/monumental-orchestra/</p>"

  title: Information Architecture for Everyone
  abstract: "This talk makes an attempt to broadly answer the question “What is Information Architecture?” through examples from various spheres of life. It further outlines the foundational ways of organising information and includes a participatory activity to understand the practice of IA. I have previously presented this talk at World IA Day, and I plan to refine it further. Slides from the previous talk can be viewed here."

  title: DIY Solar Lantern
  abstract: "<p>This workshop is to introduce people to the exciting and electrifying world of electronics. During the workshop, people will be provided with circuit boards and electronic parts which they will solder themselves to make a solar lanterns. At the end of the workshop, attendees can take away the circuits with them.</p><p><a href='https://flic.kr/s/aHskxguCU8'>Pics from last year.</a></p>"

  title: Unfolding Origami
  abstract: "The practice of folding paper and cloth into abstract shapes and designs has existed for many centuries in Europe and Asia. However, in the 1960's this practice acquired a new language. First came the system of encoding a form in a crease pattern- a set of lines drawn on a square to represent the folds required to make a form. Following this came a system of communicating folding sequences using arrows and symbols which led to a further expansion of this language. The result of this was an explosion of new origami designs and ideas. In this sessions I will talk about a brief history of origami and how learning its language unlocked my interest in it. I will demo all the basic folds and bases used in origami and also discuss the preliminary concepts involved in designing your own origami. This session is intended for beginners."

  title: Markov Chain Models for NLP
  abstract: "<p>Markov Chains Models are the foundation of many Natural Language Processing algorithms. They ask 'given the previous X number of items in a sequence, what is likely to come next?' You can see Markov Models in action by playing with the word-suggestions when you're typing on your phone.</p>

  <ul>The workshop will cover:

      <li>The basics: what is a markov model, and how do they work? We'll do a short exercise diagramming out a model on paper, and calculating the probabilities.</li>

      <li>Some variants: Hidden-state Markov Models (HMM's), interpolated markov models, sequence generation, and Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC)</li>

      <li>Some MCM applications for NLP and bioinformatics: like voice recognition, sentence parsing, fuzzy-matching, language detection, forensic stylometry, gene-finding, and protein structure analysis</li>

      <li>If time permits, maybe the Virterbi algorithm for finding highest-probability paths through a markov model</li></ul>"

  title: Hillhacks Badge Distribution and basic KiCad workshop for circuit designing
  abstract: "<p>The goal of this workshop will be to walk you through KiCad basics so that you are able to get started. This will involve designing a simple design from sketch to gerber. We will cover following topics:</p>
  <ul>
  <li>Schematic design</li>
  <li>Netlist</li>
  <li>PCB layout</li>
  <li>Library Management</li>
  <li>Gerber generation</li>
  </ul>
  <p>I  haven&#39;t finalised the circuit which we will design. Interested people are welcome to propose a basic circuit. People can propose it via mailing list or on twitter by tagging me in their post (@Nitesh_Kadyan)</p>
  <p>This session will also be used for giving away the HillHacks electronic badge for people who backed for it. Thee badge will be provided with a set of lapel pins and a hillhacks lanyard. I will also share some personal motivation behind making the badge. </p>
  <p>People who haven&#39;t backed for the badge can still do it <a href='https://goo.gl/forms/FejCmntk9Ott2CMh2'>here</a>. It costs Rs2200 or approx $33.</p>

  title: Beyond Little Green Locks
  abstract: "<p>There is a general consensus to trust a web page when there is a little green lock present in the browser when we visit the page, There is a significant population still believes that this represents a shopping bag and hence a secure portal to do financial transactions.</p>

<p>Lets talk about how this lock works under the hood and mainly what it does and doesn't guarantee. The talk is moderately technical due to the nature of the problem, but we will cover the basics so its open to everyone interested in web security and privacy.</p>"
