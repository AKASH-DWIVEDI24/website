<p>hillhacks is passionate about making, sharing, learning, and the broad concepts of open source. Freedom, security, and environmentalism are also key to hillhackers. All of our ideas have conjoined into something exceptionally creative.</p>

<p>We are just a bunch of people that got connected by crazy and various circumstances, in a spontaneous and still very dynamic way. Many hillhackers change direction in life thanks to interactions during hillhacks - starting school, quitting jobs, moving house, launching projects. </p>

<p>
hillhacks is inclusive. Being Excellent to Each Other is a core component of hillhacks. Everyone is welcome, regardless of economic background, race, religion, caste, nationality, political view, gender, and age. </p><br>

</ul>
