<p>Over the years, some questions come up again and again. Here they are, with answers. Of course, if you don’t see your question asked and answered, ask on the mailing list.</p>

<p><b><em>Should I bring...</em></b></p>
<p><b>...my projects and tools?</b><br>
Oh yes, you should! Bring your whole project group and take a code retreat or whatever needs to be done – and get fruitful exchanges with the other participants. Please let us know what things you want to bring, so that we can arrange appropriate space for you. Also bring your hard drives full with software, documents etc you want to share. Don't rely solely on the Internet for being able to share data.
</p>

<p><b>...my camping gear?</b><br>
Yes, please! Bring your tents, mattresses, sleeping bags, pillows, blankets. We have some to share, but never enough.
</p>

<p><b>...my trekking gear?</b><br>
Yes, please! Bring your shoes, backpacks, bottles, and all that stuff, and go for as many treks and walks you can! (click on this link to get more info on walks&treks)
</p>

<p><b>...my family?</b><br>
You are welcome to bring your husband, kids, wife, parents, cousins, friends. Please let us know the details in advance, so we can help to find appropriate accommodation for you. There are plenty of things to do for all ages and interests.
</p>

<p><b>...a spontaneous session?</b><br>
Yes.*The unconference is all about spontaneous sessions. During the conference days, priority is given to curated sessions, but you may be able to schedule yourself into unused spaces.

</p>

<p>
    <b>How cold will it be up there?</b><br>
    In general it will be around 25°C during the day, and around 15°C at night. Be aware! We are on 2000 meters altitude, it can get down to 10°C and on the other hand side it can rise up to 30°C. Weather varies, but it isn’t monsoon season, so not too much rain.

    <b>I am concerned that I am too young / too old / an introvert / a single-female / a single-male / a robot / something totally different.</b><br>
    Read our note on providing a safe and friendly place for everyone. Last year we had all age groups around, and nearly 50% of our core-team are female! As we are surrounded by the ease of the mountains, you will always find enough space for yourself, if needed. You have found us, that means you are at the right place, please feel welcome!
</p>

<p>
    <b>My family is concerned that this will be way too dangerous!</b><br>
    Please have a look at the blogposts from participants from hillhacks 2014 (again over 50% female-blogs), and maybe show them the report or project description (both for funding, from last year). If it helps, we can also create any kind of official paper for your parents eyes, to make it looking more official and/or educational - “It's so very important for my career”, eh? ;) If its about the travel itself, contact us, chances are pretty high that we have someone travelling same route at same dates.
