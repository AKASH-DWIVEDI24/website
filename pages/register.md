### Event costs

There is a **day pass** for people staying off-site and a **camping pass** for
those camping on-site.  As always, we offer a sliding scale on both of these
passes to allow everyone to participate.

All passes cover lunch, access to daily talks, workshops, and activities plus
costs like equipment rentals, facilities rent, shade structures, electricity,
internet and consumables.  The camping pass also includes a tent space and the
use of shared bathing facilities.

{: .table}
|                  | Suggested   | Sliding scale    |
|------------------|-------------|------------------|
| **Day pass**     | Rs. 600/day | Rs. 300-1800/day |
| **Camping pass** | Rs. 800/day | Rs. 500-2000/day |

### How to pay
We accept cash at the event.

We don't take credit cards, PayTM, or other cashless payments.  Please bring
money with you.  Local ATMs are not within easy walking distance.

Every hillhacks organiser and participant is a volunteer.  Nobody earns a salary
or makes a profit; if extra funds are collected, we spend them to create a
better event this year or save them as start-up cash for next year.

We aim for transparency.  If you are interested in where your money goes, please
[contact us]({{site.baseurl}}{% link pages/contact-us.md %}) and we'll give you
a budget sheet.
