hillhacks is a multi-day event so clearly you will need to find somewhere to
stay, keep clean and perform vital bodily functions.  Three options are listed
below in order of preference.  Feel free to discuss your accommodation hacks on
the [mailing list][ml].


### Campsite

**This is the preferred option.**

Enjoy the great outdoors.  Camping facilities on the property are limited to
about 50 tents, so this is first-come, first-served.  When the campsite is
filled, we will identify fresh camping spots; you will need to pay a minimal
charge to the property owner directly.

You must bring your own tent, sleeping mat and sleeping bag.  We will not be
able to provide tents this year.  If you do not own a tent yet, cheap tents can
be bought at Decathlon.  In previous years, local attendees have offered to
bulk-buy tents for people and bring them to the venue.  Please discuss on the
[mailing list][ml].

You will be able to share sanitary facilities in the main venue and there is a
stream a short distance away.

### Stay nearby

If you come without a tent, you must find accommodation nearby.  There are
plenty of homestays and hotels in and around Bir Billing.  Booking in advance is
recommended.  Use your favourite search engine or app to find a space that suits
your needs and budget.


### On-site rooms

Four of the six rooms at our venue are used for workshops, a shared lounge, and
other common spaces.  The toilet and bathing facilities in these rooms are
shared by all of the campers on site.

We reserve one room as an infirmary/nursery and one for solo women travellers
who would prefer not to sleep alone in tents.  These rooms' bathing facilities
are also shared with campers and conference attendees.

If you are arriving very early in the morning, you may have a nap in the lounge
before you set up your tent later in the day.

You will need to bring your own sheets or a sleeping bag.

Please [let us know by email][e] if you would like to stay in a shared room at
the venue so we can plan occupancy.  Note that your stay in a shared room is not
confirmed until we tell you it is.  Preference will be given to attendees with
particular needs (injury, illness, infants, etc.).
