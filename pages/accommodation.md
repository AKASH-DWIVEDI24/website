hillhacks is a multi-day event so clearly you will need to find somewhere to
stay, keep clean and perform vital bodily functions.  Three options are listed
below in order of preference.  Feel free to discuss your accommodation hacks on
the [mailing list][ml].


### Campsite

**This is the preferred option.**

Bring your tent!  Enjoy the great outdoors!  There is a lot of camping space
around the venue.  You can use the sanitary facilities of the venue.  There is
also a stream a short walk away.

You will need to bring your own tent, sleeping mat and sleeping bag.

If you do not own a tent yet, cheap tents can be bought at Decathlon.  In
previous years, local attendees have offered to bulk-buy tents for people and
bring them to the venue.  Please discuss on the [mailing list][ml].


### Stay nearby

There are plenty of homestays and hotels in and around Bir Billing.  Use your
favourite search engine to find a place that fits your needs and your budget.


### Guest rooms

For those on a very tight budget who are not fond of camping.

We can accommodate a fair number of people in shared rooms at the venue.  There
are six shared rooms with bathrooms and toilets.  One of the rooms will be
reserved for hackers configured following the female paradigm.

You will need to bring your own sheets or a sleeping bag.

Please [let us know by email][e] if you would like to stay in a shared room at
the venue so we can plan occupancy.  Note that your stay in a shared room is not
confirmed until we tell you it is.
